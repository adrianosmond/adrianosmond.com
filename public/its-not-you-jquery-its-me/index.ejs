<p>I've been doing a lot of thinking lately and I've come to a shocking conclusion. I think I'm going to break up with jQuery. Maybe break up is too strong a phrase. I'm going to try a separation though. It feels a little harsh since she was so supportive through the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars#Mid_to_late_2000s:_Updated_browsers_released" target="_blank">hard times</a>. She never complained about where I took her - even the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer_6" target="_blank">really</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer_7" target="_blank">terrible</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer_8" target="_blank">places</a>.</p>
<p>The trouble is that I feel like I've outgrown her. If I'm honest she's also looking a little heavier than she used to too. I'm sure I'll still see her in my professional life from time to time. But personally it feels like I won't grow until I let her go. I know I'll miss how succinct she is and how she says it like it is - usually exactly the way I would say it myself.</p>
<p>Who knows - maybe we'll get back together. After all, I hear she's got some <a href="http://blog.jquery.com/2012/06/28/jquery-core-version-1-9-and-beyond/" target="_blank">weight loss surgery</a> scheduled.</p>
